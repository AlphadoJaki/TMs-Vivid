### <terrain_generators>
Core of the mod.

Mostly unchanged.

City_L mode only

- Both **width** and **height** of all hubs are expanded.
- street_gen **level** is adjusted to support [RWG Overhaul](https://github.com/AlphadoJaki/RWG_Overhaul_Fix/releases) Fix (No effect for those who don't use it)
- **downtown_zone_size_perc** is adjusted to support RWG Overhaul (same as above)

Mostly unchanged.

City_L mode only
